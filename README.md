# BikeSales
This project involves the comprehensive analysis of bike sales data from various companies in the USA, Mexico, and Canada. Using Power BI for data visualization and DAX queries for in-depth analysis, we developed a machine learning model in Google Colab to predict product performance based on profits made and quantities sold. The insights generated aim to enhance decision-making processes for stakeholders.
